## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)  
- npm (or yarn)

## Setup

\`\`\`bash

\`\`\`

## Running Tests

Run all tests headlessly:

\`\`\`bash

\`\`\`

Run a specific test by name:

\`\`\`bash
npx playwright test -g "user can login successfully"
\`\`\`

Run tests with browser UI visible:

\`\`\`bash
npx playwright test --headed
\`\`\`

## Test Coverage
